        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Software System Development is a graduate-level course that equips
          students with a comprehensive understanding of the principles, tools,
          and practices involved in designing and building modern software
          systems. Emphasizing a systems-oriented perspective, the course
          explores foundational and contemporary topics including Operating
          Systems, Computer Networks, Software Engineering methodologies, and
          Database Systems (both relational and NoSQL).
        </p>
        <p>
          Students will gain practical experience with industry-relevant tools
          and technologies such as Bash scripting, SQL, NoSQL databases, HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript, front-end frameworks, RESTful APIs, Python, and
          Flask. The course focuses on building scalable, maintainable, and
          secure software systems while fostering an appreciation for system
          integration, version control, development workflows, and deployment
          strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Designed for students with a fundamental background in programming,
          this course bridges theory and practice, preparing them to contribute
          effectively to complex software development projects in both research
          and industry settings.
